In an effort to reduce the energy consumption related to lighting and heating of the building, a small hydropower scheme has been installed to generate about 4 kW from the water of the nearby Afon Wybrnant stream. Water is abstracted from the river at a higher elevation (+35 m) and is then carried via a 300 m pipeline up to the powerhouse. After generating electricity in the turbine, the water rejoins the stream next to the historical farmhouse."
